## Session 3
Patty O'Callaghan session about Responsibility of AI.

## Session 4


## Session 5

Patty O'Callaghan going trough AI Machine Learning  
  
  - Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) 
    Machine Learning
  - Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
    Machine Intelligence
  - Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)
    Machine Consciousness

I believe the ultimate goal is to have the same "tool"  we have with a traditional program, something we can provide an input to and get a result (output) after its computation.  
Providing Input + Output to create the "program" is BEFORE we can actually use it (the end user can use it).

## Assessments

https://forms.gle/9ASdn7MqhsTtRxAr9  

- I understood the big difference between simple "reaction" of AI and the "create" capability of Generative AI.
- I learned what happens behind the chatbot question/answer sessions of a chatbot.
- I now know NLP basis and some technique it uses.
- I'm able to use one of the many LLVM available for free and made it to work for my scope.
- I know where to look in Google Vertex AI for creating Datasets and labeling models, recognize objects etc...
- I know what kind of tool are available for different possible problems to solve, using NLP, LLVM or a chatbot.
